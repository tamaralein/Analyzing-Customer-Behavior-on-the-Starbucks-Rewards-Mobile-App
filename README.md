## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

I worked with Visual Studio Code and Python Version 3.11.2. 

Following libraries should be installed: numpy, pandas, math, json, matplotlib.pyplot, ast, seaborn

## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>

This project focuses on analyzing simulated customer behavior data from the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The dataset reflects how users interact with various offers sent by Starbucks, which can range from advertisements to actual discounts or BOGO (buy one get one free) offers. 

## File structure<a name="files"></a>

- Analyzing Customer Behavior on the Starbucks Rewards Mobile App_Report.pdf: Report with detailed description of procedure.
- Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Notebook showing the complete code.
- Folder: data
  1.	portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
  2.	profile.json - demographic data for each customer
  3.	transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Results

The analysis revealed that discount offers had the highest completion rates, offers sent by the web got the highest completion rates and female customers showing the highest engagement. Furthermore, the completion rates increase with age and income, particularly for BOGO offers. When looking at every offer in details these trends might not be revealed for every offer.
